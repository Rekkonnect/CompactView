    in a much faster loading time

# 1.5.1 - 2023/05/31

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for comments
  - Buggy with strings that contain content delimiters. It will be properly fixed in 1.5.2.

## Fixes

- Properly load the behavior option for always executing the selected text in the query
- Better implication of the selected statement with the `Ctrl+Enter` shortcut in the query editor
- `Ctrl+Enter` does not automatically select a statement when the user had manually selected another
  part of the query

# 1.5.0 - 2023/05/29

## Features
- The SQL query editor now opens immediately after loading a database
- `Ctrl+Enter` in the SQL query editor only executes the surrounding statement around the cursor

## Optimizations
- Added an assembly dependency to the `System.Data.SqlServerCe` assembly,
and eliminated the use of reflection to interact with it
